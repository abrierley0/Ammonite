Ammonite
========

This project aims to automatically solve Pearson Edexcel A level Mathematics problems. The project may delve 
into automatically generating maths questions and answers. The result will be something similar the Matlab 
Symbolic Math toolbox I imagine, albeit more rudimentary.

This is part of my developing interest in the interface between software and physics.

Index Simplifier
----------------

This script automatically simplifies algebraic expressions using index laws.
