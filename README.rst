Ammonite
========

This project aims to automatically solve Pearson Edexcel A level Mathematics problems. The project may delve 
into automatically generating maths questions and answers. The result will be something similar the Matlab 
Symbolic Math toolbox.

The general aim is to stay grounded in mathematics.
It is also part of my developing interest in the interface between software and mathematics/physics.

Index Simplifier
----------------

This script automatically simplifies algebraic expressions using index laws.
