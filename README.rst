Ammonite
========

The project aims to automatically solve Pearson Edexcel A level Mathematics problems in the spirit of 
1960's MIT hacker culture. The project may delve into automatically generating questions and answers
to mathematical problems. The result, I conceive, will be something like the Matlab Symbolic Math toolbox.

The general aim is to develop my programming ability in the process, and to stay grounded in mathematics.
It is also part of my developing interest in the interface between software and mathematics/physics.

Index Simplifier
----------------

This script automatically simplifies algebraic expressions using index laws.
