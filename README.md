# Ammonite

This project aims to automatically solve Pearson Edexcel A level Mathematics problems. The project may also delve
into automatically generating maths questions and answers. It is thought that the result will be somewhat similar to the Matlab Symbolic Maths Toolbox, albeit more rudimentary.

This is part of my developing interest in the interface between software, mathematics, and physics.

## Index Simplifier

This script automatically simplifies algebraic expressions using the index laws (Pure Mathematics Year 1, Exercise 1A).
